### Design


**Structure**: Titles are centered, whereas subtitles are aligned to the left. Cards are arranged in a grid, aligned from left to right. Paragraphs and sections of the page are separated by horizontal lines, accompanied by a subtitle or title.

**Margin**: All body content rendered on desktop screens should span 3/5ths of the screen, with the remaining 2/5ths of the viewport split equally into margins on each side of the content. Components exempt from this rule include the carousel and footer.

**Rounding**: The first layer above the background, referred to as "the cards," is non-rounded, with a small 6px drop shadow. Images are also non-rounded. Buttons are fully rounded, while input fields have slight rounding.
